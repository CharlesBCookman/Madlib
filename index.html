    <p class="hidden">Let me tell you a story about a friend of mine, <span id="name1input">_____</span>. <span id="name1input">_____</span> worked at a <span id="placeinput">____</span> and had an awful coworker named <span id="name2input">_____</span>. <span id="name2input">_____</span> would always complain about how people would <span id="actioninput">______</span>, and even tried to get other people fired for <span id="action2input">______</span>. Enter Sparky, Sparky is a <span id="animalinput">______</span> and was beloved by everyone except of course <span id="name2input">_____</span>. One day <span id="name2input">_____</span> was being particularly rude, someone hadn't done something that <span id="name2input">_____</span> had asked because a supervisor needed them to do something else. <span id="name1input">_____</span> started helping <span id="name2input">_____</span>, and just as <span id="name2input">_____</span> started to leave the rest of the job for <span id="name1input">_____</span>, Sparky bumped into a <span id="containerinput">_______</span> on a shelf above and the whole container filled with <span id="liquidinput">____</span> poured right in front of the supervisor coming to check up who looks at <span id="name2input">_____</span> and tells him that he had told him never to leave <span id="containerinput">______</span> up there, then looks at my friend <span id="name1input">_____</span> sees what he's doing and sends <span id="name2input">_____</span> home early since they had been told to stop getting others to do their job. After that <span id="name2input">_____</span> quit which made everyone working at <span id="name1input">_____</span>'s work to celebrate.</p>
